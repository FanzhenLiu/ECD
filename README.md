**How to use**

Before run the `run_ECD.m`, please choose a network to load and properly set corresponding parameters in the `run_ECD.m`. Please see the content in `run_ECD.m` for more information.

The `W_Cube.mat` records the adjacent matrices of a dynamic network in several time steps, the `GT_Cube.mat` or `GT_Matrix.mat` records the ground truth community structures of a synthetic network in all time steps. For Real-world networks without ground truth community structures, the `firststep_DYNMOGA_cell.mat` and `firststep_DYNMOGA_enron.mat` record the community structures detected by the first step of DYNMOGA (Folino and Pizzuti 2014) in all timesteps as the ground truth community structures.

Finally, `ECD_Result` records the community structures detected by ECD in all time steps; `DynMod` and `DynNmi` record the modularity of the detected community structure at each time step and the NMI that measures the similarity between a detected community structure and the ground truth at each time step, respectively.
